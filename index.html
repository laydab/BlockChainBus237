                <h2><span class="icon">üöÄ</span> Introduction</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that records and stores transactions transparently and securely. Blockchain for supply chains removes the need for manual record-keeping that is present in conventional supply chains. Moreover, the stored records cannot be edited. As a result, the occurrence of fraud and counterfeit goods, a problem that costs many industries billions, is removed.
                </p>
                
                <p>The main purpose of blockchain technology is to be integrated into supply chain management (SCM) due to the transparency, efficiency, and innovation within an intricate system. With this technology, it reduces cost and improves efficiency by eliminating intermediaries, which in the conventional supply chain causes delays. Additionally, blockchain technology is especially beneficial for companies that receive thousands of transactions a day, as it can identify errors in real time.</p>
                
                <p>Although the traditional enterprise resources planning (ERP) technology can detect errors, it is expensive to pinpoint the source of the problem and trace the sequence. Blockchain technology in the supply chain presents many advantages for large corporations and can be a game-changer for modern business operations.

                <h2><span class="icon">üè≠</span> Impact on Industry</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is a tool that can help business managers in a multitude of ways. By automating transactions and reducing what is known as the middleman, it helps lower both costs and processing times. Additionally, the immutable records enhance trust with the stakeholders of a company, such as customers, suppliers, and regulators.
                </p>
                
                <p>The tamper-proof data storage that blockchain utilizes helps business managers in many various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain. Blockchain, along with having an innovative and competitive advantage, can support traceability, which aids in legal compliance.

                <h2><span class="icon">üè¢</span> Vendor Implementations</h2>
                <p>Several major corporations have successfully adopted blockchain technology to transform their supply chain operations:</p>

                    <div class="vendor-card">
                        <h4>üõí Walmart</h4>
                        <p>Walmart integrated blockchain technology to improve its efficiency. They were able to overcome the challenges of long-standing payment delays, as well as reconciliation effects, through using DL Freight blockchain technology, which works by automatically gathering and synchronizing information. Walmart‚Äôs new blockchain technology was a ‚Äútremendous success. Before DL Freight, over 70% of invoices were disputed. Today, less than 1% of invoices have discrepancies‚Äù (Vitasek et al., 2022). Additionally, it allowed Walmart to strengthen relationships with customers by highlighting its success and improved efficiency.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, blockchain is an important investment in the world of automobiles, with $169 billion projected to be invested worldwide. Porsche was one of the first to use blockchain technology, planning to integrate it into their vehicles. This initiative enables secure, real-time functions such as remote vehicle unlocking through the app, encrypted data logging, and temporary access permissions executed without the need for a central server. Furthermore, Porche‚Äôs model showed the impact of customer data control, demonstrating to business managers how blockchain can be an asset.</p>

                        <h4>üíª IBM</h4>
                        <p>IBM is a blockchain platform that offers its services as a blockchain services platform (BaaS). It transforms the supply chain to become more transparent through IBM Food Trust and TradeLens. Food Trust is a Hyperledger Fabric network which allows the company to share the data it chooses with chosen network participants. The retailers utilizing this network include Walmart, Nestle, and Carrefour, as it allows them to solve issues and limit wasted food. Although TradeLens has now been discontinued, it was originally developed to simplify global logistics and was the earliest product of its kind.</p>

                        <p>Nestle introduced blockchain technology to improve transparency and traceability, even allowing consumers to trace the origin of their coffee using a QR code on their products. Additionally, Nestle has many other products that use blockchain technology in various markets and product lines. Nestle‚Äôs approach to blockchain technology shows how blockchain can utilize transparency not just for regular compliance, but also as a value proposition for customers seeking ethically processed goods.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon">üîÆ</span> Future Potential & Conclusion</h2>
                
                <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
                <p>While blockchain's implementation in the supply chain provides a way to improve transparency, reliability and alleviate human error, it can be costly to set up. More importantly, after the initial investment cost, it can be tricky to ensure smooth, synchronous implementation of the technology in a business's existing operations.</p>
                
                <p>This technology can only prove relevant for businesses that trade in crucial industries (such as the pharmaceutical and food industry) or high-value industries (such as the diamond industry). There may not be much value in investing the large sum required for this technology in other everyday goods.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Integration Opportunities</h3>
                <p>The thorough record keeping has the potential to improve inter and intra-coordination. In B2B, businesses do not have to be apprehensive about opportunistic behaviour, because the existence of blockchain validates the authenticity of the goods being traded.</p>
                
                <p>There is also ample potential use of this technology when considering its integration with the Internet of Things (sensors that collect data), AI and the field of data analytics. For instance, IoT can track goods during transit, AI can use data from IoT and blockchain to predict supply chain disruptions, making blockchain a crucial puzzle piece in a highly technologized supply chain ecosystem.</p>
                
                <h3>Strategic Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Managers implementing this technology can benefit greatly only if they have identified specific challenges that blockchain can directly solve. If a more traditional software may solve the problem more cheaply, it may be unwise to implement blockchain systems. The key is to align blockchain adoption with clear business objectives and measurable outcomes.</p>
