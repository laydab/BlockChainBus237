                <h2><span class="icon">üöÄ</span> Introduction</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that records and stores transactions in a transparent and secure manner. Blockchain for supply chains removes the need for manual record-keeping that is present in conventional supply chains. Moreover, the stored records cannot be edited. As a result, the occurrence of fraud and counterfeit goods, a problem that costs many industries billions, is removed.</p>
                
                <p>The main purpose for blockchain technology to be integrated into supply chain management (SCM) is due to the transparency, efficiency, and innovation within an intricate system. With this technology, it reduces cost and improves efficiency by eliminating intermediaries, which in the conventional supply chain causes delays. Additionally, blockchain technology is especially beneficial for companies that receive thousands of transactions a day as it can source errors in real time.</p>
                
                <p>Although the traditional enterprise resources planning (ERP) technology can detect errors, it is expensive to pinpoint the source of the problem and trace the sequence. Blockchain technology in the supply chain presents many advantages for large corporations and can be a game-changer for modern business operations.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon">üè≠</span> Impact to Industry</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is a tool that can help business managers in a multitude of ways. By automating transactions and reducing what is known as the middleman, it helps lower both costs and processing times. Additionally, the immutable records enhance trust with the stakeholders of a company such as customers, suppliers, and regulators.</p>
                
                <p>The tamper-proof data storage that blockchain utilizes helps business managers in many various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain. Blockchain along with having an innovative and competitive advantage can support traceability which aids in legal compliance.</p>

                <p>Several major corporations have successfully adopted blockchain technology to transform their supply chain operations:</p>

                <div class="vendor-grid">
                    <div class="vendor-card">
                        <h4>üõí Walmart</h4>
                        <p>Integrated blockchain technology to improve freight invoice and payment system efficiency. Their DL Freight system automatically gathers and synchronizes critical information, reducing disputed invoices from over 70% to less than 1%. This transformation strengthened relationships with customers and carriers while minimizing payment delays.</p>

                    <div class="vendor-card">
                        <h4>üöó Porsche</h4>
                        <p>Collaborated with Berlin-based startup XAIN to integrate blockchain into vehicles like the Panamera. This enables secure, real-time functions such as remote vehicle unlocking, encrypted data logging, and temporary access permissions, making transactions up to six times faster than previous systems.</p>

                <h2><span class="icon">üîÆ</span> Future Potential & Conclusion</h2>
                
                <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
                <p>While blockchain's implementation in the supply chain provides a way to improve transparency, reliability and alleviate human error, it can be costly to set up. More importantly, after the initial investment cost it can be tricky to ensure smooth, synchronous implementation of the technology in a business' existing operations.</p>
                
                <p>This technology can only prove relevant for businesses that trade in crucial industries (such as the pharmaceutical and food industry) or high value industries (such as the diamond industry). There may not be much value in investing the large sum required for this technology for other everyday goods.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Integration Opportunities</h3>
                <p>The thorough record keeping has potential to improve inter and intra coordination. In B2B, businesses do not have to be apprehensive about opportunistic behaviour, because the existence of blockchain validates the authenticity of the goods being traded.</p>
                
                <p>There is also ample potential use of this technology when considering its integration with the Internet of Things (sensors that collect data), AI and the field of data analytics. For instance, IoT can track goods during transit, AI can use data from IoT and blockchain to predict supply chain disruptions, making blockchain a crucial puzzle-piece in a highly technologized supply-chain ecosystem.</p>
                
                <h3>Strategic Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Managers implementing this technology can benefit greatly, only if they have identified specific challenges that blockchain can directly solve. If a more traditional software may solve the problem more cheaply, it may be unwise to implement blockchain systems. The key is to align blockchain adoption with clear business objectives and measurable outcomes.</p>
